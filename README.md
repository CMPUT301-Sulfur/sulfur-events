# Sulfur Events

**Sulfur Events** is an Android application designed to streamline event management through a lottery-based waitlist system. Built for **CMPUT 301**, this app facilitates interaction between event organizers, entrants, and administrators, allowing for seamless event creation, waitlist joining, and profile management.

##  Project Overview

The application utilizes the **Android SDK (Java)** and **Firebase** to provide real-time data synchronization and cloud storage. It supports three distinct user roles:

1.  **Entrants:** Users who can sign up for events, join waitlists, and receive notifications.
2.  **Organizers:** Users who create events, generate QR codes, and manage waitlists/enrollments.
3.  **Admins:** Moderators who oversee the platform, managing events, profiles, and images.
